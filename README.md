# E-commerce Store Database Management System

## üìã Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive relational database management system for an e-commerce platform. The database is designed to handle all aspects of online retail operations including customer management, product catalog, order processing, payments, shipping, and marketing features.

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Schema

### **Core Entities (18 Tables)**

- `customer_addresses` - Multiple shipping/billing addresses per customer

#### **Product Catalog**
- `products` - Main product information with pricing and inventory
- `categories` - Hierarchical product categorization system
- `suppliers` - Vendor/supplier information
- `product_images` - Multiple images per product
- `product_attributes` - Flexible product specifications (color, size, etc.)

#### **Shopping Experience**
- `shopping_carts` - Customer shopping cart sessions
- `cart_items` - Products added to shopping carts
- `reviews` - Customer product reviews and ratings

#### **Order Management**
- `orders` - Customer orders with status tracking
- `order_items` - Individual products within orders
- `order_coupons` - Applied discount coupons per order

#### **Payment Processing**

## üîó Relationship Types Implemented

### **One-to-One Relationships**
- `orders` ‚Üî `shipping` (Each order has exactly one shipment record)

### **One-to-Many Relationships**
- `customers` ‚Üí `customer_addresses` (One customer, multiple addresses)
- `customers` ‚Üí `orders` (One customer, multiple orders)
- `products` ‚Üí `product_images` (One product, multiple images)
- `products` ‚Üí `product_attributes` (One product, multiple attributes)
- `categories` ‚Üí `categories` (Self-referencing for subcategories)
- `orders` ‚Üí `order_items` (One order, multiple items)
- `suppliers` ‚Üí `products` (One supplier, multiple products)

### **Many-to-Many Relationships**
- `customers` ‚Üî `products` (via `reviews` table)
- `orders` ‚Üî `coupons` (via `order_coupons` table)
- `shopping_carts` ‚Üî `products` (via `cart_items` table)

## üîí Constraints & Data Integrity

### **Primary Keys**
- Auto-incrementing INTEGER primary keys on all tables
- Ensures unique identification of all records

### **Foreign Keys**
- Comprehensive referential integrity across all related tables
- Cascade operations for dependent data management
- Restrict operations to prevent orphaned critical business data

### **Unique Constraints**
- Customer email addresses
- Product SKUs
- Order numbers
- Coupon codes
- Supplier emails

### **Check Constraints**
- Price validation (must be positive)
- Stock quantity validation (non-negative)
- Rating validation (1-5 scale)
- Email format validation
- Date range validation for coupons

### **Not Null Constraints**
- Critical business fields marked as required
- Ensures data completeness for essential operations

## ‚ö° Performance Features

### **Indexes**
- Customer email and name lookups
- Product category and supplier searches
- Order date and status filtering
- Payment status tracking
- Review product associations

### **Views**
- `product_catalog` - Complete product information with categories
- `order_summary` - Order details with customer information

### **Stored Procedures**
- `AddToCart()` - Add products to customer shopping cart
- `CalculateOrderTotal()` - Calculate order subtotals and totals

### **Triggers**
- Automatic stock quantity updates on orders
- Stock restoration on order cancellation
- Coupon usage counter maintenance

## üìä Sample Data Included

The database comes pre-populated with sample data for testing:
- 3 customers with addresses
- 4 products across different categories
- 2 promotional coupons
- 4 shipping carriers
- 4 payment methods
- Hierarchical product categories

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### **Prerequisites**
- MySQL Server 8.0 or higher
- MySQL Workbench (recommended) or command-line client

### **Installation Steps**

1. **Open MySQL Client**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p
   ```

2. **Execute the Script**
   ```sql
   source /path/to/ecommerce_store.sql
   ```
   
   Or in MySQL Workbench:
   - Open the `ecommerce_store.sql` file
   - Click "Execute" button

3. **Verify Installation**
   ```sql
   USE ecommerce_store;
   SHOW TABLES;
   ```

## üìà Usage Examples

### **Basic Queries**

**View all products with categories:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM product_catalog;
```

**Get customer order history:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM order_summary WHERE customer_name = 'Alice Johnson';
```

**Check low stock products:**
```sql
SELECT product_name, stock_quantity 
FROM products 
WHERE stock_quantity <= reorder_level;
```

### **Using Stored Procedures**

**Add product to customer cart:**
```sql
CALL AddToCart(1, 1, 2); -- Customer 1, Product 1, Quantity 2
```

**Calculate order totals:**
```sql
CALL CalculateOrderTotal(1, @subtotal, @total);
SELECT @subtotal, @total;
```
